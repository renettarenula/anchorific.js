# Anchorific demo

It can be found at `https://anchorific.netlify.app/`

# Development

Install Ichigoo

```
npm install --save ichigoo-cli
```

In order to run on development mode:

```
cd demo
npm install
ichigoo develop
```

In order to build and serve locally

```
ichigoo build
ichigoo serve
```

To build Anchorific.js file, run:

```
npm run browser:dev
```

This is important every time we update anchorific version.

This is deployed with Netlify Drop so it is not automated.
